🚀 Built Agentic AI Workflows in Hours — and Seconds!

Excited to share a side project I worked on this week:
🔗 AI-Agentic-workflows on GitHub

Using Langchain, I created Agentic AI workflows in two modes:

🧑‍💻 Low-code (Python): Took ~2–3 hours to set up logic, tools, and flow control.

🪄 No-code (Langflow): The same workflow was created in just 20 seconds using a visual drag-and-drop UI!

This really showcases the power of rapid prototyping with LLM frameworks. From logic-heavy use cases to instant visual orchestration, we now have options for both developers and non-devs to build intelligent agents with ease.

💡 Whether you're exploring multi-agent architectures, building chains for data analysis, or just want to tinker with AI workflows—this repo might give you a head start.

Would love feedback or collaboration ideas!
